AstroBit AI - Exoplanet Discovery Platform
AstroBit AI is an interactive web platform that uses Artificial Intelligence to analyze and classify exoplanet candidates from astronomical data. The goal is to make data science accessible to scientists, students, and enthusiasts, accelerating the discovery of new worlds.

## üöÄ Live Demo
You can test the live application at the following link:

https://astrobit-nasaspaceapps.onrender.com

Important Note: The demo server is a free service and may take a moment to start up if it's inactive. Uploading very large files is not recommended. To test the upload functionality, please use the test_data.csv file available in the repository.

## üìã Project Structure
Here is a brief description of the main files and folders in the project:


app.py: The main web application file. It contains the Flask server, API routes, and the logic for loading the AI model and making predictions.

model.py: The Machine Learning script. This file is responsible for training the AI model. It loads master_exoplanet_data.csv, processes the data, trains the classifier, and saves the artifacts (.joblib) and metrics (.json).

/static: Contains the front-end static files, such as CSS (styles.css) and JavaScript (script.js).

/templates: Contains the HTML files that Flask renders, such as index.html and results.html.

requirements.txt: Lists all the necessary Python libraries to run the project.

master_exoplanet_data.csv: The main dataset, compiled from missions like Kepler and TESS. This file was used to train the AI model in model.py.

test_data.csv: A smaller, pre-formatted data file, ideal for testing the upload functionality on the web application without overloading the server.

exoplanet_model.joblib: The trained and saved AI model object (Random Forest), ready to be used by the Flask application.

scaler.joblib: The saved data normalizer object (MinMaxScaler), used to prepare new data in the same way as the training data.

label_encoder.joblib: The saved label encoder object (LabelEncoder), used to translate the model's predictions.

model_metrics.json: A JSON file containing the model's performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.), generated by model.py.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project Locally
Follow the steps below to set up and run the application on your machine.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

pip (Python package manager)

2. Installation
a. Clone the repository:

git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME>

b. Create and activate a virtual environment:

#Create the environment
python -m venv .venv

#Activate on Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

#Activate on macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

c. Install the dependencies:
All necessary libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. Install them with a single command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Running the Application
With the dependencies installed, start the Flask server:

flask run

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the application running.

4. Retraining the Model (Optional)
If you want to modify the model or retrain it with new data, simply run the model.py script. This will regenerate the .joblib files and the model_metrics.json file.

python model.py

## üìù Other Notes
The AI model was trained using a RandomForestClassifier from the Scikit-learn library, chosen for its robustness and its ability to provide feature importances.
The primary data source for training the model is the NASA Exoplanet Archive.
